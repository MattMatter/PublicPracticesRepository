# PublicPracticesRepository
 Container of exercises, practice, and general learning.

Hello! If you're seeing this message I likely sent this link to you in a job application, you found it on my resume, or you happened across it by browsing GitHub.

This repository contains some of the works I've done on my own while job-hunting in order to keep my skills sharp. I decided recently before creating this repository that showing some of my work may compliment me talking about them in an interview.

As I try to learn new things every day, this repository is likely to contain more and more projects as time progresses, whether they be complete or works-in-progress.

Having made a new account, many things on here will look similar to another profile (roper777). Please rest assured that this is the same person as the other profile.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this little forward and looking at the repository!
